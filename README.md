### A lego block programming language. Seriously.
![lego](http://cdn.wallpapersafari.com/43/69/qlCby6.jpg)

## How it works
- Using a combination of a **webcam** and a number of groovy open source libraries.

## Development
- This project is being developed entirely open sourced.  Development is taking place in real time and is **completely open for public observation, commenting, and consumption**.

| Resource | Purpose | Description |

## Installation
- So you want to try to run your own version of the application? Here are some steps to follow. We plan to compress blockforge into an native application in the future, but for now, you are going to have to be clever to get it running on your own!
  1. Clone this repo.
  2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` from the cloned repo folder.
  4. **(Linux Only)** To install headless browser testing resources run `bash install_linux_testing_dependencies.sh`.
  5. **(Linux Only)** To ensure everything works, run `npm test` which will check if everything is all good.
  6. Run the server by running `npm start`.

## Nerdy Details
| tech | use | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTML | frontend | We are using HTML5 standards. (We may incorporate a templating engine like Jade in the future however!) |
| CSS/SCSS | frontend | We are rendering CSS using SCSS, a CSS preprocessor that makes complex CSS less hellish to manage. It's easy to learn and implement, so if you know CSS already, don't be afraid, evolve! |
| ECMAScript (JavaScript/JS) | frontend | We are using `ECMAScript 6` syntax (JavaScript) for frontend functionality. This means older browsers probably can't run this application. Good riddance! |
| ECMAScript (JavaScript/JS) | backend | We are using `Node 8`, the latest version of JS for backend development using `ES6` syntax. |
| Cucumber | backend/frontend | We are using Cucumber, a Gherkin test runner for code quality testing. |

| role | skill | tools | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project Manager | organization | [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2078579) | Plan, organize, and keep tabs on the different tasks and goals required to keep the project moving forward. This requires frequent contact with other team members and coming up with meaningful, valuable contributions. Open mindedness meets frugality in a playful balance in the individual that this role suits! |
| Experience Designer | design | [Github Project](https://github.com/altereagle/blockforge/projects) | Creatively think about and guide feature designs from a user centric perspective. Putting yourself inside the mind of the user would be a critical component of this individual's thought process. |
| Developer | coding | [Cloud 9(IDE)](https://ide.c9.io/kendelljoseph/blockforge) | Translate ideas into concrete structures. A good developer can churn code, a great developer can communicate effectively. Knowing that speed and recall aren't as imperative to success as clarity is a steadfast mantra for any individual who embraces the development heartbeat of a project. |
